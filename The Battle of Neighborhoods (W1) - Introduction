Introduction
After losing her job, Macarena decided that the compensation money she will use in her venture: a sushi bar. It will be located in Santiago de Chile so you should investigate where is the best location.

Business problem
To open a sushi place, you must use the Foursquare information on the communes or localities of Santiago (Chile). For this we define our target audience:
1. Schools
2. Universities
3. Offices
The above serves to ensure that we have enough customers and that we are not so close to other sushi places.
